# Flappy Bird AI üê¶ü§ñ

A versatile Flappy Bird clone featuring two gameplay modes and adjustable difficulty, all configurable via the in-game menu.

* **Manual Mode**: Take direct control of the bird with intuitive keyboard inputs.
* **AI Mode**: Watch neural networks evolve using NEAT to master the game over generations.
* **Difficulty Levels**: Switch between Normal for casual play and Hard for a true challenge.

## Project Overview

Flappy Bird AI is built in Python using Pygame. It combines interactive gameplay with advanced neuroevolution: in AI Mode, agents learn by tuning parameters like pipe speed and gap size. All settings‚Äîmode selection and difficulty‚Äîare adjusted through the app‚Äôs graphical menu before you start playing or training.

## Key Features

* **In-Game Menu**: Seamlessly switch between Manual and AI modes and choose Normal or Hard difficulty without touching the command line.
* **Real-Time Training Visualization**: During AI sessions, view generation count, top fitness score, and population size on-screen.
* **Configurable Hyperparameters**: Tweak NEAT settings by editing `config-feedforward.txt` before launching.
* **Performance Optimization**: Enjoy smooth simulations even at accelerated training speeds.
* **Modular Codebase**: Clear separation of game logic, AI routines, and configuration for easy maintenance.
